# Udacity-project-1
In this project the focus was African countries that were affected by Malaria between the years of 2000 to 2014.
Particulary the deaths that happened in these countries due to the disease
I showed two charts for each country
The first country was the Democratic Republic of Congo
The second was Kenya
The third was Nigeria
For each country I showed a map with the location and the amount of dealths with one chart
The secound chart showed in more detailed the amount of people that were affected over time
